## Daily Ron-spiration
This React app (bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is a tribute to Ron Swanson from NBC's Parks and Recreation. The home page displays one of the many gems of Ron Swanson's iconic quotes, courtesy of the [Ron Swanson quotes API](https://github.com/jamesseanwright/ron-swanson-quotes) - yes, such a wonderful thing does exist. Gifs on the gifs page are sourced from [Giphy](https://giphy.com/).

### Additional libraries used include:
* [React Masonry Component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-masonry-component)
* [React Copy To Clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-copy-to-clipboard)

### Initiatives in progress:

* Creating and implementing use cases for standard and custom React Hooks
* Adding user authentication, and a Favorites page where logged in users can save their favorite gifs
